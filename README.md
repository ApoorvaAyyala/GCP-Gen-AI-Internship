# GCP-Gen-AI-Internship
Google Cloud Generative AI

In this virtual internship, I've had 3 main modules.
The Modules include Beginner: Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path, Advanced: Generative AI for Developers Learning Path & lastly, Gemini for Google Cloud Learning Path

## Beginner: Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path
### Introduction to Generative AI
I've learnt to:

• Define generative AI
• Explain how generative AI works
• Describe generative AI model types
• Describe generative AI applications.
### Introduction to Large Language Models
I've learnt to:

• Define Large Language Models (LLMs)
• Describe LLM Use Cases
• Dxplain Prompt Tuning 
• Describe Google’s Gen AI Development tools
### Introduction to Responsible AI
• Understood why Google has put AI principles in place
• Identified the need for a responsible AI practice within an organization 
• Recognized that decisions made at all stages of a project have an impact on responsible AI 
• Recognized that organizations can design AI to fit their own business needs and values
### Prompt Design in Vertex AI Labs
#### Challenge Scenario
You're a member of an educational content startup specializing in engaging learners with the natural world. You've formed a partnership with Cymbal Direct, an online retailer launching a new line of outdoor gear and apparel designed to encourage young people to explore and connect with nature.

Cymbal Direct wants to create a marketing campaign for its new product line that leverages the power of generative AI. Your task is to help them develop a set of tools within Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform that will streamline the generation of the following:

Evocative Product Descriptions: using image analysis to inspire short, descriptive text that captures the essence of their products and the feeling of being in nature.
Catchy Taglines: focused on highlighting product features, the target audience, and the desired emotional response.

Task 1. Built a Gemini image analysis tool

Task 2. Built a Gemini tagline generator

Task 3. Experimented with image analysis code

Task 4. Experimented with tagline generation code

#### Key Learnings from the above Lab:
⋆ Getting started with prompt engineering using the Google Gen AI SDK.

⋆ Applying best practices for prompt design, including conciseness, specificity, and task definition.

⋆ Explore various text generation use cases with the Google Gen AI SDK, such as:Ideation, Question answering, Text classification, Text extraction, Text summarization.

⋆ Created applications from prompts.

⋆ Design effective prompts.

⋆ Engineer and manage prompts.

⋆ Used multimodal prompts.

⋆ Installed the Gen AI SDK & Connected to an API service.

⋆ Sent text and multimodal prompts.

⋆ Learnt how to set system instructions.

⋆ Configured model parameters and safety filters.

⋆ Managed model interactions (multi-turn chat, content streaming, asynchronous requests).

⋆ Used advanced features (token counting, context caching, function calling, batch prediction, text embeddings).
### Responsible AI: Applying AI Principles with Google Cloud
• Learnt about the impact of AI technology and Google's approach to responsible AI, and was also introduced to Google's AI Principles
• Learnt about how to make a business case for responsible AI, based on the report 'The Business Case for Ethics by Design' by the Economist Intelligence Unit
• Learnt about ethical dilemmas and how emerging technology such as generative AI can surface ethical concerns that need to be addressed
• Learnt about how Google’s AI Principles were developed and explore the ethical aims of each of these Principles
• Learnt about the practical application of responsible AI and how to operationalize AI principles by setting up and running reviews
• Learnt about the process of identifying possible ethical issues and identify issue spotting questions to think critically about the potential benefits and harms of a use case
• Learnt about the next steps and resources I can use to continue my responsible AI journey.
## Advanced: Generative AI for Developers Learning Path
### Introduction to Image Generation
Had a sneak peek about diffusion models - the theory behind diffusion models and how to train and deploy them on Vertex AI. 
### Attention Mechanism
Learnt how attention(a powerful technique that allows neural networks to focus on specific parts of an input sequence) works, how it can be used to improve the performance of a variety of machine learning tasks, including machine translation, text summarization and question answering.
